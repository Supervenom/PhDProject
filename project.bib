	shorttitle = {The lambda calculus},
	abstract = {The revised edition contains a new chapter which provides an elegant description of the semantics. The various classes of lambda calculus models are described in a uniform manner. Some didactical improvements have been made to this edition. An example of a simple model is given and then the general theory (of categorical models) is developed. Indications are given of those parts of the book which can be used to form a coherent course.},

	isbn = {978-0-521-39115-3},
	abstract = {Term rewriting systems, which developed out of mathematical logic, consist of sequences of discrete steps where one term is replaced with another. Their many applications range from automatic theorem proving systems to computer algebra. This book begins with several examples, followed by a chapter on basic notions that provides a foundation for the rest of the work. First-order and higher-order theories are presented, with much of the latter material appearing for the first time in book form. Subjects treated include orthogonality, termination, lambda calculus and term graph rewriting. There is also a chapter detailing the required mathematical background.},

	abstract = {We present an algorithm for lambda expression reduction that avoids any copying that could later cause duplication of work. It is optimal in the sense defined by Lévy. The basis of the algorithm is a graphical representation of the kinds of commonality that can arise from substitutions; the idea can be adapted to represent other kinds of expressions besides lambda expressions. The algorithm is also well suited to parallel implementations, consisting of a fixed set of local graph rewrite rules.},
