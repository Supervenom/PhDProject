	abstract = {We propose a framework to prove almost sure termination for probabilistic programs with real valued variables. It is based on ranking supermartingales, a notion analogous to ranking functions on non-probabilistic programs. The framework is proven sound and complete for a meaningful class of programs involving randomization and bounded nondeterminism. We complement this foundational insigh by a practical proof methodology, based on sound conditions that enable compositional reasoning and are amenable to a direct implementation using modern theorem provers. This is integrated in a small dependent type system, to overcome the problem that lexicographic ranking functions fail when combined with randomization. Among others, this compositional methodology enables the verification of probabilistic programs outside the complete class that admits ranking supermartingales.},

	abstract = {In order to extend the modeling capabilities of rewriting systems, it is rather natural to consider that the firing of rules can be subject to some probabilistic laws. Considering rewrite rules subject to probabilities leads to numerous questions about the underlying notions and results.We focus here on the problem of termination of a set of probabilistic rewrite rules. A probabilistic rewrite system is said almost surely terminating if the probability that a derivation leads to a normal form is one. Such a system is said positively almost surely terminating if furthermore the mean length of a derivation is finite. We provide several results and techniques in order to prove positive almost sure termination of a given set of probabilistic rewrite rules. All these techniques subsume classical ones for non-probabilistic systems.},

	abstract = {Markov chains are central to the understanding of random processes. This is not only because they pervade the applications of random processes, but also because one can calculate explicitly many quantities of interest. This textbook, aimed at advanced undergraduate or MSc students with some background in basic probability theory, focuses on Markov chains and quickly develops a coherent and rigorous theory whilst showing also how actually to apply it. Both discrete-time and continuous-time chains are studied. A distinguishing feature is an introduction to more advanced topics such as martingales and potentials in the established context of Markov chains. There are applications to simulation, economics, optimal control, genetics, queues and many other topics, and exercises and examples drawn both from theory and practice. It will therefore be an ideal text either for elementary courses on random processes or those that are more oriented towards applications.},

A number of carefully chosen problems of varying difficulty are proposed at the close of each chapter, and the mathematics are slowly and carefully developed, in order to make self-study easier. The author treats the classic topics of Markov chain theory, both in discrete time and continuous time, as well as the connected topics such as finite Gibbs fields, nonhomogeneous Markov chains, discrete- time regenerative processes, Monte Carlo simulation, simulated annealing, and queuing theory. The result is an up-to-date textbook on stochastic processes.

Such a definition only makes sense when the sub-calculi are stable by β-reduction. Surprisingly, we are able to give a complete description and classification of such stable sub-calculi, in a rather algebraic way; and surprisingly again, we discover some unexpected such subcalculi.
